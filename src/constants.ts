    longDescription:
      'The Smart Helmet IoT Safety System is an embedded rider safety platform engineered to proactively eliminate motorcycle accidents through real-time hardware sensing and wireless ignition interlocking.\n\nLead embedded developer on the dual-unit rider safety system. Shortlisted as Top 50 out of 10,000+ teams (top 0.5% acceptance) in Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025.\n\nThe dual-unit system links a sensor-equipped helmet with a motorcycle ignition receiver circuit via low-latency RF 433MHz wireless communication. It continuously monitors helmet wearing compliance (IR proximity sensor), rider alcohol levels (MQ-3 sensor), and driver drowsiness (IR eye-blink sensor), automatically cutting bike ignition within 500ms under unsafe conditions. Built with Arduino microcontrollers, C/C++ firmware, relays, and an I²C LCD status display, it incorporates a 5-second RF fail-safe signal protection for real-world environmental reliability.',
